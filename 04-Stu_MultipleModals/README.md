# Multiple Modals

In this activity, you will add modals to two buttons and change the modal content.

## Instructions

- Add two sets of modal source code from the [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/modal/#live-demo).

- Change the id of the modals to be more descriptive.

- Update the `data-toggle` and `data-target` attributes of the buttons.

- Alter the modal code to accomplish the following.

  - The "Sign Up" button should trigger a small size modal that includes:

    - A title.

    - A sign up form. (username, email, password)

    - A "Submit" button that dismisses the modal.

  - The "Learn More" button should trigger a large size modal that includes:

    - A title.

    - A grid system to add an image and text.

    - A "Close" button that dismisses the modal.

## Hints

- Use the documentation for the respective Bootstrap components needed for this activity.

- Modals not working? Does your code have *everything* needed for interactive elements?

## Bonus

- Add a third button that triggers a model that has a carousel of images.

  - For best results use images of the same size.
