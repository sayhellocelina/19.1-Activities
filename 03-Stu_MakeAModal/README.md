# Make A Modal

In this activity, you will build a webpage from a blank HTML file. The page will include a button that will trigger a modal when clicked.

## Instructions

1. Set up your HTML in the starter file.

  - Be sure to include the Bootstrap CSS CDN as well as the required JavaScript CDNs.

2. Add:

   - A "More Information" button

   - A modal with:

     - Some custom content

     - One button in the footer that dismisses the modal

3. Alter the code to customize the modal content and have to modal appear when the button is clicked.

4. Discuss the code with a partner to answer the following questions:

   - What attributes link the button to the modal and allow it to be shown when clicked?

   - What attribute has to be present on an element that dismisses the modal when clicked?
