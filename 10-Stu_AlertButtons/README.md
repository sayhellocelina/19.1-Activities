# Button Alerts

In this activity, you will create a button that triggers a dismissible alert.

## Instructions

- Set up your HTML file with all the necessary CDNs.

- Add a button that says "Save".

- Add an "info" level dismissible alert that says "File saved!". The alert should be hidden when the page loads.

- Create an event listener that shows the alert when the Save button is clicked.

- The alert should dismiss when the `X` button is clicked.

## Hints

- Use CSS to hide the alert upon page load.

- The dismissable alert is a Bootstrap component. 

## Bonus

- Add an additional "Delete" button that when clicked shows a different alert that says "File Deleted!"

- Alter the code so that you can hide and show the alert multiple times without reloading the page.
