# Button Alerts

In this activity, you will update click handlers to make elements appear/disappear.

## Instructions

- Update the event listener to show the image element when the button is clicked.

## Hints

## Bonus

- Add a button and associated code which hides Harry Potter temporarily

- Add a button and associated code which removes Harry Potter forever

- Add a button and associated code which hides another button
