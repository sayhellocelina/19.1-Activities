# Event Handlers

In this activity, you will write some jQuery to handle click events on buttons.

## Instructions

- Open up the [Unsolved/event.html](Unsolved/event.html) and the [Unsolved/event.js](Unsolved/event.js) files.

- Update each the event listeners for the Name, Age, and Location to `console.log` your respective information when each button is clicked.

  - For example, when Jill clicks the 'Name' button, it would log 'Jill' to the console.

- You may want to update the HTML for one of the buttons as well...

## Hints

- When adding new content/listeners, look to the existing code as an example.

- To log a list of people, look into `arrays`.

## Bonuses

- Add an additional "Birth Year" button that will log your birth year when clicked.

- Add an additional "Family" button that logs 3-5 of your closest family members when clicked.
